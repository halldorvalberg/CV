# Fonts folder for genpdf.js

Drop TTF files here for the script to use. The script expects these files (example names):

- `Roboto-Regular.ttf`
- `Roboto-Italic.ttf`
- `Roboto-Bold.ttf`
- `RobotoMono-Regular.ttf` (for monospace/code)

You can swap these for any other TTFs but either update the paths in `genpdf.js` or copy/rename your font files to match the names above.

Example: download the Roboto family from Google Fonts and place the four required files here.
